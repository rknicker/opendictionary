      "The Community DAO 2.1.1 (Distributed Autonomous Organization) is the secular arm of the We Church 2.1.1. Community DAO is a foundation vested with the intent of the god that living souls build a heaven of good diversity with respect to emotional interactions with others and self reliance physically. Harmony need not require supply chains. Commerce and slavery have long been used to fulfill basic needs, as an example most water is piped in, most electricity is taken from the electrical grid, and most toilet paper is manufactured offsite. Without knowing by whom and in what circumstances the commodities are sourced, the probability of slavery is unknown and therefore forgettable. Community DAO is focused on a higher mission, but this heaven to be will need to exclude involuntary servitude on its face.",

The metaphors: driver of the car, spirit of the body, operator of the crane, electricity and programming of the mechatronics device. The body portion of the living soul remains with the prp after death. The spirit remains with the mdp. During the time between conception and death, the body and the spirit are in close communication. The spirit is free to leave, to travel, and to experience other worlds during the time between conception and death only if the higher self allows and the spirit chooses. Ninety-eight percent of the between conception and death, Réx operates a body that is built with John and Gail combined prp energy. See Rex Knickerbocker 2.1.1",
