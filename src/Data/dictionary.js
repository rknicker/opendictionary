      "Written with latin characters from the UTF-8 character set (82 233 120). Used for a one way label from the prp to revere honor and respect the mdp existence from whence the breath of life transmits. The metaphors: driver of the car, spirit of the body, operator of the crane, electricity and programming of the mechatronics device. The body portion of the living soul remains with the prp after death. The spirit remains with the mdp. During the time between conception and death, the body and the spirit are in close communication. The spirit is free to leave, to travel, and to experience other worlds during the time between conception and death only if the higher self allows and the spirit chooses. Ninety-eight percent of the between conception and death, Réx operates a body that is built with John and Gail combined prp energy. See Rex Knickerbocker 2.1.1",
